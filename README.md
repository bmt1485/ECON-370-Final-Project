# ECON-370-Final-Project
Final Project for ECON 370 (Chinas Economic Development). Analyzes household savings rates in China.

This repository contains my final project for ECON 370: China’s Economic Development. The project investigates the structural and policy-driven factors contributing to China’s exceptionally high savings rate—currently one of the highest in the world at 44.4% of GDP. The analysis combines theoretical economic frameworks, such as the Solow Growth Model, with empirical methods including linear regression modeling on global economic indicators.

Special focus is given to the long-term effects of the one-child policy and its unintended role in shaping household savings behavior. Using cross-country data from the World Bank, UN, and theglobaleconomy.com, I construct a regression model isolating key predictors of national savings rates in high-income countries. The model reveals a statistically significant and economically meaningful inverse relationship between consumption and savings, aligning with both economic theory and policy relevance.

The report concludes by evaluating China’s recent efforts to pivot toward a consumption-driven economy, assessing tools such as interest rate policy, the Required Reserve Ratio (RRR), urbanization incentives, and Hukou system reforms.

All visualizations and regressions were conducted in R, and the analysis integrates data science practices with macroeconomic reasoning to inform policy-oriented conclusions.
